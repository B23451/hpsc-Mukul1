and directories in the folder is xx.".

mv a/b.txt a/c.txt # Changes the location of the file
cp a/b.txt a/c.txt # Copies the file
# cp requires -r option to move directories
rm -options <file/directory name>
options -r(remove directories) -i(prompting y/n before removing)
wc *
# will give an output spanning multiple lines stating the number
# of lines, words and characters in each file ending with
# a total line. If directories are also present then it will 
# output <name> it is a directory then 0 0 0 followed by name
wc *.txt # will print size of all text files no directory issue here
wc -m(for char) -w(for word) -l(for line)
sort -n(alphanumeric sort) -r(reverseorder) <filename>
My name is Mukul > Introduction.txt (won't work)
We need
echo My name is Mukul > Introduction.txt
sort -nr
cut -d , -f 2 a.txt
# -d is dilimiter here set to "," can be set to ":" etc
# -f 2 is for 2nd column, -f 1-4 works defalt delimiter "Tab"
cut -d, -f 2 animals.csv|sort # Prints dictionary sorting of 2nd col
cut -d, -f 2 animals.csv|sort|uniq # Prints only unique elements
# using uniq before using sort don't assures it sort is nessesary
cut -d, -f 2 animals.csv|sort|uniq -c # Prints the count of each element
